sorting algorithms
1)Time based sorting 
2)Space based sorting
3)Stablity based sorting (when 2 keys with same value,then in result sort first coming key should be first)
4)Internal sort(main memory or ram) vs external sort (on disk or tape)
5) recursive(Quick sort,merge sort) or non-recursive(Insertion sort,selection sort)


Selection sort: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUDLRan2DWM&index=2&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwKedT2KfDMB9YA5DgASZb3U)
1) Consider 'A' as array that need to be sorted.
2) smallest number from 'A' will be moved to index of 0. next smallest will be moved to next index of 0

Bubble sort: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdtq5uKz-w4&index=3&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwKedT2KfDMB9YA5DgASZb3U)
1) First element will be compare with next element swap them when second element is small.
2) In each pass largest number will bubbled with last index

Insertion sort (good than Selection,Bubble)
1) arr[0] will be sorted portion and from a[1] to a[n] un sorted portion
2) arr[1] will be compared with a[0] if a[1] is less than arr[0] then swap value of arr[0] and arr[1]
3) now arr[0,1] are sorted portion. arr[2] will be compared with arr[0,1]. arr[2] will be inserted based on value

Merge sort algorithm
1)Splited arr till it is single . each of single merged with parent by sorted order
